                                On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an
                                unrestricted free agent. On July 1, his management company, Klutch Sports,
                                announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers; the deal was officially
                                completed on July 9. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent, Rich
                                Paul, explained, "In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014,
                                when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was
                                just about doing what he wants to do." Reaction to the move was more positive than
                                his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt
                                that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.

                                Following James's signing, the Lakers rounded out their roster with a controversial
                                collection of playmakers and veterans. As a result, to begin the 2018–19 season, the
                                team struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first
                                seven games. In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's
                                strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10
                                rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers, and
                                four days later he scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Heat. After
                                blowing out the Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14,
                                but James suffered a groin injury in the process. He ultimately missed a career-high 17
                                consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him. The
                                team was unable to recover and failed to qualify for the postseason, marking the first
                                time that James missed the playoffs since 2005 and the first time he failed to reach the
                                Finals since 2010. On March 7, the Lakers announced that James would begin a
                                minutes restriction, and on March 30, he was officially ruled out for the remainder
                                of the season. James's final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3
                                assists per game, and despite his inconsistent campaign, he was ultimately named to the
                                All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in 12 years that he did not make the All-NBA
                                First Team.

                                After a disappointing 2018-19 season. Lebron James had new teammates. Anthony Davis was
                                traded to the Los Angeles Lakers along with DeMarcus Cousins who signed as a free agent
                                in 2019.
