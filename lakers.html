                                James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall
                                pick of the 2003 NBA draft. In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points
                                against the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for most points scored by a
                                prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.

                                James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection in 2004–05, contributing 13 points, 8
                                rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.

                                <br>

                                In 2006–07, James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6
                                steals per game. Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing
                                skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus. The
                                Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered
                                the playoffs as the East's second seed. That same year, the Cavaliers made it all the
                                way to the NBA Finals but, to only get swept in 4 games by the San Antonio Spurs.

                                In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role
                                following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt. Behind his
                                leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the
                                league for the second consecutive season. Due in part to his increased minutes as
                                the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production,
                                averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50
                                percent shooting en route to another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland
                                advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round.
                                James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only
                                20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered its worst loss in
                                franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a
                                smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd. The Cavaliers were officially
                                eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10
                                assists, and nine turnovers in the losing effort.
