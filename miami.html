                                James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this
                                time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers,
                                Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced
                                on a live ESPN special titled <bold>The Decision</bold> that he would sign with the
                                Heat. The
                                telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised
                                $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising
                                revenue, which was donated to other charities.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                James was humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks in 2011, and the experience
                                inspired him
                                to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped him regain a
                                sense of joy on the court. He also decided that his post game needed improvement,
                                so he worked with Hakeem Olajuwon during the offseason. Behind James's
                                significantly-expanded skillset, Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6
                                record. He was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of
                                27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent
                                shooting.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Chris Bosh to an abdominal
                                injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1. James responded with a
                                40-point, 18-rebound, and 9-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series. To
                                compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power
                                forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the Conference Finals against
                                the Celtics. Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15
                                rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a
                                "career-defining performance". Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning
                                them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James's budding rival, Kevin
                                Durant. Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a
                                lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps. In Game 5, he
                                registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever
                                championship and James's first championship. James was unanimously voted the Bill
                                Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and
                                7.4 assists per game. His full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points,
                                9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA
                                history by ESPN.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game
                                while setting multiple shooting efficiency records. That same month, the Heat
                                also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.
                                Based on these accomplishments, James's performance was described as a "month for the
                                ages" by Sports Illustrated. Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise
                                and league best 66–16 record, and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling
                                just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award
                                unanimously. His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists,
                                and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.
                                In Game 1 of the Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a
                                one-point victory against the Pacers. Throughout the series, his supporting cast
                                struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his
                                responsibilities to those of his "Cleveland days". Despite these struggles, the
                                Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs, signifying a rematch for
                                James from his first Finals six years earlier. At the beginning of the series, he
                                was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell
                                behind 2–3. In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series,
                                including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory. In Game
                                7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami
                                over San Antonio with 37 points. He was named Finals MVP for the second straight
                                season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the
                                championship round.
