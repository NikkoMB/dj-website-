                                On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he
                                officially became an unrestricted free agent. On July 11, he revealed via a
                                first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the
                                Cavaliers. In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was
                                well received. On July 12, he officially signed with the team, who
                                had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his
                                departure. A month after James's signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from
                                the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In January of the <b>2014–15</b> season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back
                                strains, which represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career. In
                                total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6
                                rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a
                                baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls. In
                                the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making
                                James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals. For most
                                of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to
                                injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities. Behind his leadership, the
                                Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games.
                                Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,
                                averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship
                                round.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                During the <b>2015–16</b> season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court
                                controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.
                                Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record
                                in the East. James's final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists
                                per game on 52 percent shooting.In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably
                                to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors, who
                                were coming off a record-setting 73-win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell
                                behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering
                                back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive
                                wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a
                                number of key plays, including <bold>"The Block"</bold> on Andre Iguodala, as Cleveland
                                emerged
                                victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming
                                the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.
                                James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game
                                7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3
                                blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history
                                to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating
                                in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.

                                The <b>2016–17</b> season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;
                                James later described it as one of the "strangest" years of his career. Following a
                                January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front
                                office for constructing a team that he felt was too "top heavy", for which he received
                                countercriticism. The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with
                                James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and
                                turnovers (4.1) per game.In Game 3 of the first round of the postseason, he
                                registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland
                                to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest
                                halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history. In Game 5 of the Conference
                                Finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the
                                league's all-time postseason scoring leader. The Cavaliers won the game and the
                                series, advancing to their third consecutive Finals against the Warriors, who had signed
                                James' rival Kevin Durant during the offseason. Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12
                                rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a
                                triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Prior to the start of the <b>2017–18</b> season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by
                                trading Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer
                                wanted to play with James. After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by
                                winning 18 of 19 games in December. Their turnaround began with a victory over the
                                Wizards where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total
                                of his career and tied a franchise record. In January, the Cavaliers had a losing
                                record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort. Following another round
                                of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of
                                historical milestones; for example, on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight
                                games scoring in double digits. James eventually finished the season with averages
                                of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a career-high 9.2 assists and 4.2 turnovers per
                                game.In the playoffs, he guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the
                                Warriors. Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career,
                                including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors.
                                In the first game of the Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but
                                Cleveland was defeated in overtime. Following the defeat, James injured his hand
                                after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the
                                remainder of the series. The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James
                                averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists per game for the Finals.
